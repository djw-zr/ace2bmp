Program ace2bmp
===============

    This program is designed to convert 'ace' format files, used to store texture images for MSTS, the Microsoft Train Simulator, and other 3-D graphics programs, into bitmap format files.  
    
    The program has been developed using GNU/linux.  The shell command to compile the program is then just:
       make
    The program can then be run with the commands:
      cd tests
      ../ace2bmp 12_AU_Ironbark_A.ace
    This will generate the file "12_AU_Ironbark_A.ace" in teh current directory.  Alternatively:
      ../ace2bmp 12_AU_Ironbark_A.ace NewFileName.bmp
    will put the output in the new file
    
    The directory 'tests' contains examples of the three other 'ace' sub-formats.
    
Windows
=======

     The makefile "make_windows" can be used in the same way to compile the program for windows using the MinGW-W64 windows software and a normal windows shell.
